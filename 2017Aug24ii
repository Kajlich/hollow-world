In the last 24hrs I've gone though some more coderbyte challenges (1 or 2) and I found an old old bookmark
from <a href>http://www.CodingBat.com>CodingBat</a> and did 7 challenges there. It starts slow and easy and stays that way...
which is kinda nice for some no brainers. 

Even on a 2 liner, such as: 

<a href="https://pestenebun.smugmug.com/My-First-Gallery/n-CXvjVN/i-bSZ9sNs/A"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-bSZ9sNs/0/4a5db0f7/M/i-bSZ9sNs-M.png" alt=""></a>

is enough to make me work and figure out parentheses, and run into a few other silly bugs.

So, I'm about to continue with, hopefully the last few chapters of <a href https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Fundamentals/83603-2.html>this intro to javascript.

After that I'm on to the fun stuff. Even though most of it is over my head, I want to see what basic things can be done in solidity on the ethereum chain and start learning those. It's a lotof working figuring out code flow, terminal, installs, ports, and whatever the hell else is going on - but I'm sure bit by bit it becomes normal and understood.

So far - this guy is the best source for me. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CB0ZkvogP7tnCTDR-zV7g/featured>Decipher Media</a>
