Yesterday I went up and through chapter 9 in Lynda Programming Fudamentals
and did the first 4 Coderbyte challenges. I think it does those based on you
ability level, I can only assume I started at the bottom. I reversed a string,
made a string change to the next letter of the alphabet and some stuff like that.

I also started watching and playing along with a few ethereum developer vids. 
Some people sending there first contracts.

The setup is super confusing and using Terminal to do all of this installing and 
the flow from terminal to text editor to wherever, all is lost on me.

I installed xCode, iTerm2, Atom, Homebrew and Geth  - what order I did it? No clue
Maybe the order above (just changed to that order).

Mainly so that i had something to read while falling asleep, bedside, I got a kindle 
book. Blockchain for Dummys. It seems like it will get technical, which I want, and
seems to have a very good Author/Expert. Just based on bio, she seems to have good vantage
on technicals, overview, and implecations.

What else, I've been listening to Analysis in Chains, Unchained, and just added 
Blockchain Dynamics this morning. I'd like a more technical pod... looking.
