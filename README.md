So fill it up!


Erm, what a bummer that I have to go and bust my ass to try and learn something new just so I can get involved in something I'm excited about. Picking an initial direction is difficult but I suppose unnecessary given that the basics are the basics. My biggest goal here is to be efficient, yet thorough and learn the fundamentals with a mind on where I hope to be. Continuing to try and figure out just where that is will help.

The good news is that I do have a lot of experience, living as me. So if I can just implement lessons learned, I'm going to be rocking this shiat in no time.
